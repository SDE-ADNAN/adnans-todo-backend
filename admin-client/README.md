dashboard should display the user’s profile information and a list of the user’s
todos.
For authentication, user profile info You can use a JSON file or a static
JavaScript object for mock username &amp; password data.

such as JWT. Without login, the user should not be able to see the dashboard.

when creating a todo it can be stored in a global context.

entirely up to you how you design this feature. get inspiration from existing
Todo apps
